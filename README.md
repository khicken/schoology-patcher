# schoology-patcher
A simple Chrome/Opera extension that removes the stupid, stupid "Overdue" section on Schoology.

Install steps:
1. Download zip under the "Releases" tab (latest source code zip)
2. Skip this step if you're in the FUHSD district (default). If not, edit the 'manifest.json' file site to your schoology site
3. Go to chrome://extensions in your browser (tested on Chrome and Opera)
4. Toggle developer mode (switch should be on top left/right)
5. Click "Load unpacked..." and select the downloaded zip file


Current version:
- v1.0.2 (working)
- Only removes "Overdue" section

Todo:
- A better logo
- Toggle switch
- Other page settings
